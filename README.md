# This is an attempt at a dice game similar to Greed/Farkle/Cosmic Wimpout/Hot Dice/Zilch/Zonk. The rules are:  
Number of players: 2 or more (up to 5)  
The game is played with five six-sided dice.  
Every player rolls a dice in the beginning to determine who goes first.  

First turn: player rolls all five dice. Look for:  
-5's and 1's. 1's award the player 100 points while 5's give 50 points.  
-3x the same roll. Having 3 of the same dice awards the player points qual to that dice x 100. Rolling three 1's gives 1000 points instead of 300.  
-4x the same roll. Same as triplets, but the amount of points given is twice as large.  
-5x the same roll. Same as above, but the amount of points given is thrice as large.
